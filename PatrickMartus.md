Hello,
My Name is Patrick Martus.
I'm a computer Science student in my Last semester at Washtenaw Community College.
After I leave WCC I plan to transfer to either Eastern Michigan University or the University of Michigan Flint.
I like to play video games and work on projects like building computers, running my own servers, and 3D printing.
I have a cat named Mochi (like the food).
